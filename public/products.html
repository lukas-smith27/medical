                        <p>B&J Medical is a premiere contract manufacturer of high quality medical 
                            devices and instruments, specializing in high precision and tight tolerances. 
                            In the project profiled here, a low profile cannulated short thread screw, 
                            also called a bone screw, was manufactured utilizing a state of the art Swiss 
                            lathe and ram EDM equipment. Precision milling and turning processes were applied 
                            to 316 stainless steel in order to create the customer specified configuration, 
                            maintaining a tight tolerance of +0.001” / -0.000” throughout. This unit is 
                            intended to stabilize and aid in the fixation of fractures and fusions. The thread 
                            screw was treated with electropolishing and passivation processes for impurity 
                            removal and longevity, and left with a raw machined surface finish. Parts were 
                            thoroughly inspected for quality and accuracy using CMM, visual, and dimensional 
                            inspections.<br>

                            <br>The completed thread screw dimensions were 4.0 mm in diameter and 60 mm in length, 
                            with a head diameter of 0.216 mm, a minor thread diameter measuring 0.102 mm, and 
                            major thread diameter of 0.157 mm. 425 units were produced after a turnaround time 
                            of 5 to 6 weeks, packaged and shipped according to customer specifications.

                        <p>Utilizing a state of the art 5 Axis Machining Center, the skilled 
                            technicians at B&J Medical manufactured the contour locking compression 
                            plate highlighted here. This part, also called a bone plate, is used 
                            to immobilize fractured bone segments in order to promote proper 
                            healing. 316 stainless steel was precision milled and turned to meet the 
                            required form, holding a tight profile tolerance of 0.05 mm throughout. The 
                            part was treated with electropolishing and passivating processes to maximize 
                            corrosion resistance and improve surface appearance. Each manufactured bone 
                            plate exhibited an ultra smooth 8 RA finish.<br>

                            <br>Overall dimensions for the compression plate were 225.29 mm in length, 21.42 mm 
                            in width, and 5.16 mm thickness. 22 units were machined in this instance, after 
                            a 5 to 6 week turnaround time. B&J Medical has a strong commitment to quality; 
                            employing an intensive structured quality process including flow chart and control 
                            plan integration as well as FMEA analysis techniques. Parts are subjected to comprehensive 
                            post production and in process inspections including CMM, dimensional, visual, first 
                            article, and IIR inspections. All products and processes uphold the stringent standards of 
                            ISO 13485 codes covering medical devices.

                        <p>B&J Medical was commissioned to complete the manufacturing of a lag screw sheath 
                            highlighted here, a project reflective of the critical medical components produced 
                            on a daily basis. This sheathing was composed of 17 - 4 stainless steel, precision 
                            machined utilizing state of the art equipment including a 5 axis CNC machine center and 
                            Swiss lathe. Expert milling and machining processes were carried out to meet the specific 
                            contours of the part, holding a tight tolerance of ±0.03 mm throughout. The part was also 
                            heat treated for corrosion and abrasion resistance, and a tin coating applied at the tip. 
                            The sheathing’s shaft was polished to a satin finish as required.<br>

                            <br>The unit was carried through a full quality control process, including dimensional, visual, 
                            and CMM inspections, as well as FAS and IIR methodologies. Production planning was coordinated 
                            with flow chart and control plan systems, and the unit was completely analyzed with FMEA techniques. 
                            All products met customer standards and the stringent requirements of the ISO 13485 code. Finished 
                            dimensions of the lag screw sheath were 250.60 mm in length and 14.77 mm in diameter. 55 units were 
                            manufactured within a 6 to 7 week turnaround time.
